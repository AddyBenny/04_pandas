I will be analyzing the district-wide standardized test results. With access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. I aggregated the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

The final report includes the following:

1. The district Summary
Created a high level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics, including:
- Total Schools
- Total Students
- Total Budget
- Average Math Score
- Average Reading Score
- Percentage(%) Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
- Percentage (%) Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
- Percentage (%) Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading).

2. School Summary
Created an overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
- School Name
- School Type
- Total Students
- Total School Budget
- Per Student Budget
- Average Math Score
- Average Reading Score
- Percentage(%) Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
- Percemtage (%) Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
- Percentage (%) Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)

3. Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
Created a table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include:
- School Name
- School Type
- Total Students
- Total School Budget
- Per Student Budget
- Average Math Score
- Average Reading Score
- % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
- % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
- % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)

4. Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
Created a table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include all of the same metrics as above.

5. Math Scores by Grade**
Created a table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

6. Reading Scores by Grade
Created a table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

7. Scores by School Spending
Created a table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). Used 4 reasonable bins to group school spending. Included in  table each of the following:
- Average Math Score
- Average Reading Score
- % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
- % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
- % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)

8. Scores by School Size
Repeated the above breakdown, but this time grouped schools based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).

9.Scores by School Type
Repeated the above breakdown, but this time grouped schools based on school type (Charter vs. District).

Use the pandas library and Jupyter Notebook.
